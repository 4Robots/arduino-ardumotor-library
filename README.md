Arduino library for the SparkFun Ardumoto Motor Driver Shield

Overview:
---------

This project is a free initiative to create an Arduino library for the !SparkFun Ardumoto Motor Driver Shield. 
The main goal is to provide a library that simplifies the usage of this particular motor shield in Arduino projects.

Features:
---------
  * Set the motor at a desired speed: range -100 up to +100
  * Brake the motor
  * Change the motor speed slowly

Library Usage:
--------------
  * Download the source
  * Place the "ArdoMoto" folder in your Arduino1.0+ "libraries" folder
  * Open example sketch: "file", "Examples", "Ardumoto", "SetSpeed" (or "Braking" or "SlowChange")
  * Connect the shield (and connect Vcc and GND on the shield to an extra power supply )
  * Compile & upload code
  * The motor should be running as described in the examples
  
How it all Works:
-----------------
  * Coming soon

Version History:
----------------
  * Version 0.2: everything tested on hardware + more useful examples
  * Version 0.1: wrote the code without testing it on actual hardware   

Roadmap:
--------
 * Version 0.3: ?
